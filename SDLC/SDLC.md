	The client for this website is a company known as Nice Dude family. The goal of this site is to sell rubber ducks to people. The requirements include a flashy homepage that will introduce the product.  Each member of the team must create 2 pages of the site which includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in both pages. Each page needs to have at least 4 buttons and each of those buttons changes the theme of the whole page of the site the person is on. The success of the website will be based upon peopleâ€™s thoughts and criticism of the site. If they believe it is easily accessible, good on the eyes, and not confusing to navigate. The target audience of the site is most likely children and their parents because they have to ask for money in order to buy this product. There is no budget, and this is a new site. This is going to be an e-commerce site/online shopping site because the audience will be people who are looking to shop and buy things.
